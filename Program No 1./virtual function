Pool table
Arun has a pool table(8 ball-pool tablesa) and it is rectangular in shape. 
The pocket of the pool table is a circle shape. 
Arun wants to calculate the perimeter of the pool table and the perimeter of its pocket.
 Help him to find out.
Note: Use pure virtual function.
Create a class with the name Shape.
Create two methods named Enter_data() and Perimeter() as pure virtual function.
Create a class with the name Rectangle and inherited from a class Shape.
The class needs two fields with the name length and breadth of type float.
Method named Enter_data() without any parameter, it needs to get the value of length and breadth.
Method named Perimeter() without any parameter, it needs to calculate the perimeter of rectangle.
Create a class with the name Circle and inherited from a class Shape.
The class needs one field with the name radius of type float.
Method named Enter_data() without any parameter, it needs to get the value of radius field.
Method named Perimeter() without any parameter, it needs to calculate the perimeter of circle.

Input Format :
Input consist of 3 integers.
First input represents the length of pool table
Second input represents breadth of pool table
Third input represents radius of the table pocket.

Output Format :
Output consist of 1 integer 1 float.
First output represents the perimeter of pool table.
Second output represents perimeter of pool tableâ€™s pocket 

Sample Input:
74
30
17
Sample Output:
Perimeter of rectangle: 208
Perimeter of circle: 106.76

    Shape *shape2 = new Circle(17);

    cout << "Perimeter of rectangle: " << shape1->perimeter() << endl;
    cout << "Perimeter of circle: " << shape2->perimeter() << endl;

    
}
